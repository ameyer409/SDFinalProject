Lessons Learned
This project illustrated how imperative it is to be clear and concise with planning as well as being flexible to work with life circumstances(ex. moving) along with different timezones
The planning of projects to this scale is more important than the coding. Once we have a vision of what we were making and made sure everything was mapped, the idea came to life way faster
Allowing individual expression and freedom working on this project allowed for us to become more engaged with the project
Communication on larger scale programs is truly the most important aspect
